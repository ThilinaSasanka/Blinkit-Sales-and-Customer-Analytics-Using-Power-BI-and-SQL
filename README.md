## Blinkit-Sales-and-Customer-Analytics-Using-Power-BI-and-SQL

### Project Aim
This project aims to provide a detailed and data-driven analysis of Blinkit's business operations by integrating Power BI and SQL for advanced analytics and visualization. 
The primary focus is on three core areas: sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. 
Using SQL, raw data from Blinkitâ€™s databases is extracted, cleaned, and transformed to ensure accuracy and relevance. 
Power BI is then utilized to create interactive dashboards and reports that visualize key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and patterns.
